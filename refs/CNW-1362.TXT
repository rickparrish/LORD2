  walls of BoneTown pass by, seems like you're being lead out into the woods
  a bit.
  A minuet later you find yourself gasping for air hanging from a tree by a
  rope.  You hang on tough as you can, through the images you still get you
  see the gang slowly start to head away, back to the city.  Suddenly, the
  rope gives!!  And with a snap you fall to the ground, just barely alive.

  `2 This is a LoRD2: New World, with every known GOOD IGM installed.
  with absolutely no conficts. Also, a few IGMs have been merged, moved
  around, modified and enhanced, only for the better.
     For example:
           `!?@The Wedding Chapel in the clouds is MUCH better now, support
                for NPCs too. :)
           `!?@Andrew Town, removed, but kept house and put in KnotWood.           `!?Andrew Town, removed, but kept house and put in KnotWood.
           `!?@The Canoe (you use the canoe in many places)
           `!?@KnotWood Villiage (moved to better location)
           `!?@Ralphie's Roses (totaly re-done it, much better now)
           `!?@added houses to a few towns (didn't look like a real
                 town with only shops, moved towns closer together,
                 instead of spread out all over all the time.)
           `!?@plus many others...
`k
 `$There are a few NEW IGMs never before seen, these are my personal
 IGMs which I've created. A lot of the coding was created by me. The IGMs
 which I've made are:
               `!?@NPCs now offer quests
               `!?@TAXES
               `!?@NPC CHARACTERS!!! (now 61 NPCs)
               `!?@Bed of Roses
               `!?@The Locker Room Safe House
               `!?@Pouch of Documents (incomplete but sufficient)
               `!?@Blue Water Falls (incomplete)
               `!?@Time is a concept now, years, ages, bdays, etc.
`k
        
 `$Minor DDO-F/X support. Included is the LORD2.FNT v2, you should ask
  your SysOp to make this file available for you to d/l.  DDO-F/X requires
  that you are using the FREEWARE (or registered) LiTerm.
  You have LORD2.FNT version #?
  (the "? should show a version number if you have font version 2+)
  (If you see an odd looking "j", you do not have the proper LORD2.FNT or
  no font)

       `2if you want to help.
       `2NOTE: A DDO-F/X font has already been created.

              `@More NPC CHARACTERS
`k
 `2I would like to thank all those IGM makers for making such
  good IGMs for such a good game. I would of course also like to
  thank Seth Able for another job well done.
  PS, I heard he's working on a CGI web based game, possibly similar
  to LoRD2. :)

  `%Help and strategy for the new adventurer.
  `0LORD II`2:`0 New World `2is a very different kind of game.  There is a
  huge world to explore (`0over 300 screens`2) many people and animals to meet (not
  all of them nice) and other REAL players to befriend and kill `0-`2 even while
  they are online playing at the same time!
 `$ You can be good or you can be evil.  You can save the world or you can
  destroy it.
  `%Find some cash!
  `2Do this by 'pushing' against the table in 'your' house.  (the one you
  started in)  With this money you can buy cheap things at the store.
  `%Get berries for your mom.
  `2Just west of your cottage there is a small patch that looks different
  than the rest `0-`2 try pushing against it.  You'll find some berries.  If you
  see a certain block of grass or stone that looks different, try pushing
  against it `0-`2 you never know what you'll find. (most likely something
  good)
  `%Fight monsters, heal yourself.
  `2This isn't such an unfamiliar idea!  But it is more tricky now `0-`2 First,
  find an area that looks like it might contain monsters.  (usually away from
  towns and villages)
  Next `0-`2 Walk around.  You will randomly encounter various beasts/people and
  be able to kill and sometimes talk with them.  Some areas contain a `0HIGHER`2
  chance of running into things.  
  When you are low on hitpoints, you will need to heal yourself.  Inside
  Stonebrook there is such a place.  Later, when you have more gold you may
  wish to purchase items that have the same effect `0-`2 different color potions
  are the easiest way to heal on the road.
  `%Raising Levels
  `2No matter how long you have been playing the game, it is `0ALWAYS`2 possible
  to improve your skills by gaining a level providing you have the experience.
  `2In all the land there is only ONE place you can do this `0-`2 Barak's Training
  center in Greentree.  Beware of Barak though, he is kind of a jerk.
  `%What is alignment?
  `2This is what determines what kind of a person you are - naughty or
  nice.  `00`2 is average, `010`2 is very nice and `4-10`2 is very
  nasty.
  Someone who is nasty might see different options then someone who is nice -
  depending on their level of evil they might have an option to kick a beggar
  in the head where a nice person would have had 'give him some gold' as an
  option.  Get it?
  `%Arming weapons and armour 101.
  `2Before you can use them you need to arm them.  From the map menu, hitting
  `0V`2 will bring up your `0stat screen`2.  This where you can see things
  like what you are holding and how strong you are.
  You equip and use items the same way - by highlighting them with the
  light bar and pressing enter.  You will then be given a list of options
  that can be done with that item.  Some items have more than one use.
  After equiping a weapon or armour, pay close attention to your overall
  Attack and Defense.  The level these increment is how you know how good
  a particular piece of equipment is!
  `%Getting jobs and quests.
  `2Certain people you talk to will let you 'conduct business' - this usually
  means they have a job for your to do.
  If it involves going somewhere you have never heard of - do not accept it
  and see if they have any others.  You only get 4 job offers per day max by
  default so be smart! 
  `$Quick Tip: `2Finish the quest on the same day and you will get a bonus!

  `2Turgon embarressed me in front of the students again.  He has no right
  to do this.
`k  `r1`%  2-29  `r0
  `2I was beat by a student with 24 experience today!  Turgon told Aragorn
  and Santiger about it immediately... gawd I hate him!
`k  `r1`%  3-03  `r0
  `2Mother made some pointed comments about how nice it would be if I got
  my own place.. that old hag, I'll show her I make plenty of money!
`k  `r1`%  3-23  `r0
  `2I took 20 gems from the student gem deposit today.  No one saw me.
  I now am afraid to try to sell them...  I will wait until people forget.
`k  `r1`%  4-03  `r0
  `2Turgon saught me out today in an attempt to 'teach me the proper way
  to handle twin swords'.  I can't believe his ego!  It was all I could do
  to tell him I was busy.
`k  `r1`%  4-12  `r0
  `2I have only just become sober.  Last night I did something terrible..
  In a drunken rage while others were at a party celebrating the death of
  `4The Red Dragon`2 (it was one of Turgon's students that did it.. I will
  never hear the end of this) I went to Turgon's house and hid the gems
  behind his bookshelf.
  My heart is heavy now, I hope the gems are never found.
`k  `r1`%  4-18  `r0
  `2TURGON SUCKS!  I decided to play some dice for a few minutes during
  training with some students and was reprimanded by Turgon himself in
  front of everyone.  Even Halder was laughing!
  Later I left an anonymous note at the councils door.  I told them Turgon
  had taken the gems, and I told them exactly where to find them.  I hope
  that old coot has not found them and moved them...
`k  `r1`%  4-22  `r0
  `2Turgon has been banashed from Greentree!  Things could not have worked
  more beautifully!!!  I told the council today that Turgon had been stealing
  things all along.. it explained many disappearances..<snicker> I told them
  all the other trainers but I took part - and it was I wrote the note.
`k  `r1`%  4-23  `r0
  `2The council has made me the master trainer for my 'service to the 
  community'.  I will finally be able to start the Barak Training center
  like I have always dreamed!

- Taxes are payable at SysOp Castle, or out on the road via another
 tax collector.                                       
- The current tax rate is `%`v15%`$.
- Taxes are calculated once every year, at the beginning of each new year.
- If taxes are not paid by the middle of the year. There is an interest
 rate of `%`v16%`$ per day. If taxes are over `%`v17`$ gold and the date is after
 half the year, a bounty will be put out on that person.
- EVERYONE MUST pay their taxes.
- If you are unable to afford your taxes, you will be sent to the GreenTree
 Prison to work on grinding stones. 
- All taxes collected are stored in about 200 various secured vaults
 through-out the realm.

;    Taxes. v1.1
;
;   created by: Joel Gathercole
;   Last Modified on Dec 29, 2000
;   An official CNW IGM,
;   currently will only work in CNW.
;
; All payable at SysOp Castle
;
; - Some guidelines for the taxes-
;taxes are calculated yearly.. and must be paid before the next round of
; taxes is calculated.
; If taxes are not paid by the middle of the year. There is an interest
; rate of `v16 per day. If taxes are over $10,000 and after half the year,
; a bounty will be put out on that person.
;
;  Both players and NPCs MUST pay their taxes.
;
; On occasion in the daily random events of the npcs. they will try to
; pay their taxes automaticly.. but everyone may not get a chance to, or
; may not be able to afford it.
;
; All taxes collected are stored in secured vaults through-out the realm.
; Guarded and unguarderd.
;
; Players can get quest points by bringing NPCs to the SysOp Castle so
; the NPC can pay their taxes. If NPC does not have enough cash, they
; will ask the player for help. If player helps.. special other bonuses.
; if the npc taxes are not able to be paid, there is no bonus and the
; npc still owes. No de-credit to player. It was the NPC's responsibility.
;
;
; Vault #200 is the GIVE-A-WAY flag, if is more than 0 then the realm
; will give away money to 1 lucky player or npc the next day.
